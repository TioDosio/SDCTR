// VER PORQUE É QUE SE METER A VARIAVEL NAO DÁ MAS 11 DÁ

- ver power_max e mandar alfa fazer pratico no LED

- Meter D no PID mas a 0

- Debug can bus porque o do meio não funciona

- delay é 10 - jitter

- Mensagens Can-Bus

- Fazer jitter slide 7  h-10

- verificação de parametros interface

- testar interface

- LUX measurement
    -Good (should do): The function takes repetitive measures to filter the noise present
    in the individual measurements.

- LED driver
    - Good (should do): Implement functions that allow for specification of the LED
    dimming in different formats (e.g. duty cycle, percentage, PWM range, etc).

- System Identification ???
    - Sufficient (must do): Implement a function that computes the static gains of the
    system at initialisation.

- Luminaire PID controller
    - Good (should do): The controller should be robust to external disturbances and
    tuned to have dynamical characteristics compatible with the requirements. Perform
    experiments showing that your controller is improved with respect to a baseline solution.

- Can-Bus communication protocol
    - Montar e Copiar código

Embedded Concurrent Programming
    - Sufficient (must do): Implement a concurrent application on the microcontroller
    with a control task, a Can-Bus communication task, a PC to Can-Bus message
    routing mechanism (hub function), and a user interaction task. The concurrent
    application must be of the non-blocking type, so no task can prevent other tasks
    from executing.



notas:

Simulate system X = G*u + d

calibration of H and tao once

Para que serve o tao?

2stage:

- hub is the pico that receives the messages and that pico messages to the others

- distributed control: consesssus algoritm

- extra commands on the interface

- Communication between picos

- Network Wake-up
    - Tell the other picos that the pico is on
- Each pico needs to know his influence lux on the other picos

Gama = G*u +o

Gama -> 3*1
G -> 3x3
u -> 3*1
o -> 3*1

- Gama on some desk = Sum(Gij*ui) +oi

- each pico only needs a 3*1 gain 1 needs [k11 k12 k13]

- turn all off if i need to compute the gain
